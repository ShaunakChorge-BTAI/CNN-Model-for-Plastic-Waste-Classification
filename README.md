## Project Description  
Plastic pollution is a growing concern globally, and effective waste segregation is critical to tackling this issue. This project employs a CNN model to classify plastic waste into distinct categories, facilitating automated waste management.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this project is the **Waste Classification Data** by Sashaank Sekar. It contains a total of 25,077 labeled images, divided into two categories: **Organic** and **Recyclable**.  

### Key Details:
- **Total Images**: 25,077  
  - **Training Data**: 22,564 images (85%)  
  - **Test Data**: 2,513 images (15%)  
- **Classes**: Organic and Recyclable  
- **Purpose**: To aid in automating waste management and reducing the environmental impact of improper waste disposal.

### Dataset Link:  
You can access the dataset here: [Waste Classification Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data).  

## Model Architecture  
The CNN architecture includes:  
- **Convolutional Layers:** Feature extraction  
- **Pooling Layers:** Dimensionality reduction  
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Classification  
- **Activation Functions:** ReLU and Softmax
